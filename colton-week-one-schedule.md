# Week One: Shoot and Edit Something for Yourself

**Goal:** By Friday at 5pm, you have a finished piece — shot, graded, edited — that is yours.

---

## Weekend

Do these whenever. Don't overthink it.

- [ ] **Brain dump:** 10 YouTube video ideas in 10 minutes. No filtering. Just titles. Put them in your Idea Parking Lot.
- [ ] **Shoot:** Still life in the garage. Single light. BRAW. 10-15 minutes of footage you don't hate. That's it.

## Daily Rhythm (Mon–Thu)

Same structure every day. Pomodoros within blocks however you want.

| Block | Time | What |
|-------|------|------|
| Morning | 9:00–12:00 | Deep work |
| Lunch | 12:00–1:00 | Break (food, games, dogs, whatever) |
| Afternoon | 1:00–4:30 | Deep work |
| Wind down | 4:30–5:00 | Review what you did, set tomorrow's focus |

**Hard stop at 5:00.** Even mid-flow. This builds trust with yourself.

## Monday — Setup & Learn

**Focus:** Get your project set up correctly and understand *why*.

- [ ] Create new Resolve project
- [ ] Set up color management:
  - Color Science: DaVinci YRGB Color Managed
  - Input Color Space: Blackmagic Design Film Gen 5
  - Timeline Color Space: DaVinci Wide Gamut / Intermediate
  - Output Color Space: Rec.709 Gamma 2.4
- [ ] Import your weekend footage
- [ ] Watch: Cullen Kelly — "Color Management in Resolve EXPLAINED" (YouTube)
- [ ] Take notes: What does a CST node actually do? What's the difference between input/timeline/output color space?
- [ ] Apply a CST node to your footage. See the difference. Understand it.

**End of day checkpoint:** You can explain in one sentence what color space transforms do.

---

## Tuesday — Grade

**Focus:** Make your footage look how you want it to look, with intention.

- [ ] Open your project
- [ ] Grade using only:
  - Lift / Gamma / Gain (primaries)
  - CST nodes as needed
  - NO LUTs
- [ ] Get your true blacks and contrast dialed
- [ ] Take notes: What's working? What's fighting you?
- [ ] Save stills of your before/after

**End of day checkpoint:** Your footage looks *intentional*, not accidental.

---

## Wednesday — Edit (Rough Cut)

**Focus:** Find the rhythm. Build something.

- [ ] Pull selects — mark your best moments
- [ ] Build a rough cut (60-90 seconds is fine)
- [ ] Don't polish — just get the structure
- [ ] Find a music track if you want one (or leave it silent, up to you)

**End of day checkpoint:** You have a rough cut with a beginning, middle, and end.

---

## Thursday — Refine & Export

**Focus:** Make it feel finished.

- [ ] Refine your edit — tighten cuts, smooth transitions
- [ ] Add sound design or music if you haven't
- [ ] Color check — does the grade hold across the whole piece?
- [ ] Export a version
- [ ] Watch it on your phone
- [ ] Watch it on your TV
- [ ] Note what feels off (if anything)

**End of day checkpoint:** You have an exported video that exists in the world.

---

## Friday — Review & Close

**Focus:** Light day. Finish clean.

- [ ] Watch your video with fresh eyes
- [ ] Make small tweaks if needed (don't spiral — set a timer if you have to)
- [ ] Export final version
- [ ] Move file somewhere you won't lose it
- [ ] Write 3 sentences: What did you learn this week?
- [ ] Update your Focus Dashboard for next week

**End of day checkpoint:** It's done. You made something.

## Rules for the Week

1. **Pick the mode before you open software.** Check this doc first.
2. **Pomodoros are your friend.** Use them however feels right.
3. **Lunch is a real break.** Step away from the desk.
4. **5:00 means 5:00.** Close the laptop. Walk away.
5. **Done is better than perfect.** You're building a habit, not a masterpiece.
